## Installation

#### Prerequisites

- CMake (https://cmake.org/download/)

#### Download

- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/ajmd17/ace-lang.git`
- Enter the directory with `cd ace-lang`

#### Building

- Enter the `build` directory with `cd build`
- Generate build files using `cmake ../src`
- If you are using a Unix system, run `make`. The main executable file will be placed in the folder `./ace/bin/`.
- If you using a Windows system with Visual Studio, open the generated .sln file.

#### Running

Once you're done compiling Ace (as well as its different components), an executable simple called 'ace' should be created.
If you run that in a terminal window, Ace will run in REPL mode (Read Evaluate Print Loop). You will be able to type lines of code and have them evaluates as you go.
You can also run ace with command line arguments to run from a file, or decompile generated bytecode.

To run from file, use the command `ace filename.ace` (where filename.ace is your actual filename).
This will generate a file containing executable bytecode named `filename.aex`. It will also run that executable file, printing the output into the terminal window.

To decompile the generated bytecode file, use this syntax: `ace -d filename.aex` where 'filename.aex' is the name of the generated bytecode file.
This command will show you the bytecode instructions the Ace compiler generated, which is what the Ace VM would have executed.
