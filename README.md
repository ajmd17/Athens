# Ace Programming Language

Ace is a dynamic programming language created in C++. 
It features optional typing and is inspired by languages such as C++, JavaScript, Rust and Ruby.

Statements in Ace do not require semicolons. 
Don't use them unless you have to keep multiple statements on the same line (in which case, you should consider changing the code to be clearer anyway).

## Building

Ace is set up with CMake, so you can just go into the 'build' directory and run the command `cmake ../src` to generate makefiles or project files.
Once that's done, type `make` if you are using Makefiles, or just open the project files in your IDE if that's what you generated.

## Running

Once you're done compiling Ace and it's different components, an executable simple called 'ace' should be created.
If you run that in a terminal you will be able to type lines of code and have them evaluates as you go.
You can also run ace with command line arguments to run a file or decompile Ace bytecode.

To run from file, simply use this command: `ace filename.ace` where 'filename.ace' is your actual filename.
This will generate a file containing executable bytecode named `filename.aex`. It will also run that executable file, showing you the output.

To decompile the generated bytecode file, use this syntax: `ace -d filename.aex` where 'filename.aex' is the name of the generated bytecode file.
This command will show you the bytecode instructions the Ace compiler generated which the Ace VM has then executed.

## Examples

#### Modules

Currently, all Ace code files must start with a `module` declaration, with the name of the module following.
Example:

```
module ace_example
```

This `module` declaration will allow you to use your code from other files, using the syntax: `ace_example::some_global_variable`.

In the near future, I will be adding the ability to create multiple modules within the same file.
This will allow you to pack a whole library into one file for easy distribution.
It will probably look like this:

```
module some_module {
    // ...
    // some code here
    // ...
}

module other_module {
    // ...
    // some code for other module here
    // ...
}
```

#### Hello World

Now that we've created our module 'ace_example', let's make it print something to the screen.
We can print something using the `print` statement, like this:

```
print 'Hello, world!'
```

Notice that we placed `'Hello, world!'` in single quotes. 
In Ace, strings can be typed with either single quotes or double quotes.

The print statement can also take multiple arguments, using commas:

```
print 'Hello ', 'World'
```

#### Variables

Variables can be declared within a module, function, or any other block of code.
Examples:
* `let x = 5` will create a variable named `x` with a value of `5`. The type of `x` will be `Int`, which cannot be changed to a different type once it is created. Another way to write it is by manually telling the type of `x`, by writing it like this: `let x: Int = 5`.
* `let x: Any = 5` will do the same thing as the code above, except for the fact that the type of `x` will be able to change to whatever you want, meaning the code `x = 'Hello'` is perfectly valid.
* Alternatively, you can omit the `let` portion of the declaration. This is new functionality and may end up becoming the default. The only problem is you _must_ manually tell the type of the variable. It looks like this: `x: Int`.
* To combat the above problem with having to write out the type of the variable, I added 'lazy declarations', which work the same way that declarations work in Python. Simply writing `x = 5` will do one of two things:
  * If `x` is already declared, it will set `x` to have a value of `5`.
  * If `x` has not been declared, it will declare it with the type `Int` and set it to have a value of `5`.

When you create a variable, it will be set to the type of whatever you assign it to. If not, you must manually enter the type you want it to be after the `:` character. To let a variable be able to be fluid between types, you must manually tell it to be `Any`.

Now that that's out of the way, let's see some example code!

```
b: Int       // creates 'b' (will be set to 0 by default)

a = 5        // creates 'a' and sets it to be 5
b = 10       // sets 'b' which was already declared to 10

print a      // prints out the number 5
print a + b  // prints out the number 15

// a = 'Hello'    ERROR: cannot change the type from 'Int' to 'String'
c: Any = 100  // creates 'c' and sets it to be 100

print c       // prints out the number 100

c = 'Hello, again'

print c       // prints 'Hello, again' onto the screen
